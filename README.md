# NLPDisasterTweets

by Arun Agarwal (Submission on Kaggle as aablaze17) [Arun Agarwal](https://github.com/aagarwal17)) 

My code for NLP Disaster Tweet Kaggle Competition. Completed for CIS 4496 (Projects in Data Science) Honors Contract.

This repository hosts all code, documentation, and data related to our team's solution to the Kaggle competition, [*NLP Disaster Tweets*](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview). 
The challenge of this competition is to classify Twitter tweets as 0 or 1 to represent a fake or real natural disaster, respectively.
My current approach involves implementing various preprocessing techniques commonly used for text data as well as a [BERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.5.1/_modules/transformers/modeling_bert.html) (Bidrectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Model, a family of masked-language models which is used to help computers understand the meaning of ambiguous language in text by using surrounding text to establish context.

### Repository Structure:

The `Code` directory hosts code related to the project and its corresponding documentation.

The `Docs` directory hosts documentation for the project.
This directory primarily hosts design documentation, reports, and presentations.
For code documentation, see the `Code` directory.

The 'Results File' directory hosts the submission csv file for the Kaggle competition, generated after having run the code in the Code directory.
